Sie soll eine lockere Kooperation verschiedener Webentwickler ermöglichen, die sich regelmäßig zum Austausch über die neusten Webtechnologien treffen und sich gegenseitig bei der Webentwicklung im Fullstack unterstützen. <br> <br>Egal ob Du gerade auf Schienen, einem Segelboot, einer Insel, einem Elefanten und/oder auf Kaffee bist, ein Knotenproblem in einem Container löst oder Du noch gar keine Ahnung davon hast, was damit gemeint ist: <b>Du bist herzlich eingeladen beizutreten und mit zu machen!</b></p>\n<p><b>Wir treffen uns jeweils am ersten Arbeitstag im Monat</b>.
