NodeSchool events have been held around the world, and successfully introduce beginners to NodeJS, JavaScript, and the command-line. We're excited to host a NodeSchool chapter here on Bainbridge Island! NodeSchool events also serve as an excellent meetup/hangout spot for the local NodeJS community. The in-person workshops give you a chance to learn NodeJS and JavaScript (and more!) in a laid-back, collaborative environment where your peers and mentors can help you through any issues or problems you may have. You can also help others if you already have NodeJS/JavaScript experience. Fun Fact: You may also work on the workshoppers in the comfort of your own home, if you need help open an issue on our github repository.
