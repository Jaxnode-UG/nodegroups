We'll talk about a lot of things, OOP, Android, iOS, JavaScript, AngularJS, Node.js, and others. Let's learn and share to make a better ecosystem of programming in Indonesia. And improve the number of quantity and quality of our 60.000 local software engineers!</p>\n<p>While in other side, JLP also initiates to gather other related meetups and communities to join together. We intend to connect and consolidate various technical meetups and communities so that we can learn together. We are a platform for supporting others.
