We want to think and discuss about the real reason for using computer systems within organisations, about organisational structures that support new and efficient ways of working, about using open source software and technology in new and interesting ways.</p>\n<p>The idea is to have a few topics which we choose in advance and then to have some presentations about new software or recent insights gathered from all over the place.

For example: can you make OS deployment and maintenance more generic so you could have cross-platform  OS teams that service both UNIX/Linux and Windows?<br>\n\n</p>\n<p>• New technology review! For example: what can be achieved with Node.js? How does Node compare with things like Java + Vert.x?, libev? What about using Java 8's new Lambda expressions to do functional programming? What about Clojure and Scala?<br>\n\n</p>\n<p>• Exchange of experiences with regards to techniques used, methodologies, what works and what doesn't; maybe a presentation here and there!<br>\n\n</p>","created":1397043561000,"city":"Den Haag","country":"NL","localized_country_name":"Netherlands","state":"","join_mode":"approval","visibility":"public","lat":52.08,"lon":4.28,"members":55,"organizer":{"id":138932092,"name":"Rubin Simons","bio":"","photo":{"id":186202202,"highres_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/6/b/a/highres_186202202.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/6/b/a/member_186202202.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/6/b/a/thumb_186202202.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com"}},"who":"Automatons","group_photo":{"id":350695132,"highres_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/7/5/c/highres_350695132.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/7/5/c/600_350695132.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/7/5/c/thumb_350695132.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com"},"timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam","category":{"id":34,"name":"Tech","shortname":"Tech","sort_name":"Tech"}},{"score":1675,"id":19099607,"name":"Nodeschool Seoul","link":"https://www.meetup.com/Nodeschool-Seoul/","urlname":"Nodeschool-Seoul","description":"<p>Nodeschool Seoul 커뮤니티 활동가분들의 대화는 <a href=\"https://gitter.im/nodeschool/seoul\">Gitter</a>(<a href=\"https://gitter.im/nodeschool/seoul\" class=\"linkified\">https://gitter.im/nodeschool/seoul</a>)에서 이뤄지고 있습니다. 현재까지 예정된 오프라인 워크샵은 없으며 다만 멘토에 관심있는 분들끼리 워크샵을 열어보기 위해 모임을 갖고자 의견을 나누는 중입니다. 관심있는 분들은 <a href=\"https://github.com/nodeschool/seoul/issues\">Github Issue</a>나 <a href=\"https://gitter.im/nodeschool/seoul\">Gitter</a>에 참여하세요! <br></p>\n<p>Nodeschool is an global opensource initiative to help people learn JavaScript, Node.js, functional programming and much more.
