So are we. Join us so we can learn together!</p>\n<p>Here are some of the technologies we love to champion:</p>\n<p><b>Oracle Application Express (APEX)</b></p>\n<p>APEX is a declarative framework for building web applications on the Oracle database. Using only a browser, and with just basic knowledge of application development, it is possible to create robust, secure, and scalable web applications. APEX applications utilize the latest HTML5 and CSS3 technologies and even include a feature named Dynamic Actions that can add JavaScript to applications without having to write any code.</p>\n<p><b>Oracle JET</b></p>\n<p>To assist developers working on JavaScript based, single-page applications (SPAs), Oracle developed the JavaScript Extension Toolkit (JET). JET is a collection of open-source JavaScript libraries, combined with a set of Oracle-contributed JavaScript libraries that make it as simple and efficient as possible to build applications that consume and interact with Oracle products and services.</p>\n<p>Note: while we think Oracle JET is a great choice for building enterprise JavaScript apps, we’re certainly not opposed to using other technologies. AngularJS, Ember.js, React, Vue.js, and all the others are welcome too!</p>\n<p><b>Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS)</b></p>\n<p>These days, front-end developers want their data in JSON format, but not all data is best persisted in JSON format. For many applications, the relational model will be the best way to store data. With ORDS, we can have the best of both worlds. We can use the many features of Oracle Database to build a robust, scalable persistence layer and then use ORDS to expose that layer RESTfully.</p>\n<p><b>Node.js Driver</b></p>\n<p>Node.js, the platform that allows JavaScript to run on the server, has become very popular over the past few years. To best support this rapidly growing community, Oracle developed a new driver to allow Node.js to connect to Oracle Database. Now it’s possible to put the power of Node.js to work on your data!</p>\n<p><b>Oracle Database</b></p>\n<p>Introduced in 1979, this was the world’s first commercially available Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) database. Today it ranks as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://db-engines.com/en/ranking\">the world’s most popular database technology</a>.

Oder willst endlich mal Node.js ausprobieren? Nimm teil und lerne Programmieren mit Node.js ganz einfach - versprochen! Es hilft, wenn du schon mal etwas mit JavaScript gemacht hast - wenn nicht, komm trotzdem! Wir helfen gern.</p>\n<p>Wolltest du schon immer Node.js lernen, hattest aber nie die Zeit dazu? Dann komm doch zu unserem NodeSchool-Meetup in Düsseldorf.</p>\n<p>Langweilige Vorträge wirst Du bei uns nicht erleben. Bring Deinen Laptop mit und schon geht's los. Bei uns wird der Code live geschrieben.</p>\n<p>Wir sind offen für jeden. Wir glauben fest daran, dass es wichtig ist, dass jeder mit uns lernen kann, egal, ob man nie in JavaScript programmiert hat oder ob man schon Erfahrung im Node.js-Bereich hat. Deswegen bieten wir bei jedem Meetup zwei verschiedene Workshopper an, damit jeder an dem arbeiten kann, was er/sie interessant findet. Wir haben auch einen <a href=\"https://github.com/nodeschool/dusseldorf/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">Code of Conduct</a>, den wir bei unserem Meetup vollstrecken werden.</p>","created":1482139821000,"city":"Düsseldorf","country":"DE","localized_country_name":"Germany","state":"","join_mode":"open","visibility":"public","lat":51.24,"lon":6.79,"members":162,"organizer":{"id":205832406,"name":"Jennifer Drießen","bio":"","photo":{"id":256913328,"highres_link":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/0/5/0/highres_256913328.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/0/5/0/member_256913328.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/0/5/0/thumb_256913328.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com"}},"who":"Students","group_photo":{"id":456993788,"highres_link":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/3/f/c/highres_456993788.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/3/f/c/600_456993788.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/3/f/c/thumb_456993788.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com"},"timezone":"Europe/Berlin","category":{"id":34,"name":"Tech","shortname":"Tech","sort_name":"Tech"}}]
