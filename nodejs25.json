Join our group and follow us&nbsp;on twitter&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NGToronto\">@NGToronto</a>&nbsp;and t<span>weet insights </span><span>using the&nbsp;<b>#AngularJSTO</b>&nbsp;hashtag!</span><br></p>\n<p>Angular is well-known Javascript framework developed and maintained by Google and released to the community as an open source project. One of the key features of Angular is that it's built to scale. Its modular architecture and the use of Typescript as the base language makes it ideal for enterprise software with large teams.</p>\n<p>Being an opinionated framework, Angular is a good choice to develop applications in a consistent way. The core team has put a lot of effort on creating an official style guide and baking those recommendations inside of the Angular CLI. For the most part, when working with Angular, it feels like there's only one way to develop an app.</p>\n<p>Some claim that Angular is not just a framework but a platform. We can use Angular to create a web application compiled in the browser, or compile the application on the server to provide the browser with plain HTML; we can create a \"native\" mobile application with the help of Nativescript or create a desktop application with Electron. Angular brings us closer to the holy grail of one code base, multiple platforms.</p>\n<p>Angular has seen a tremendous transformation from version 1 to version 2. With a new release schedule in place that will give us a new major version of the framework every 6 months and a new minor version every month, keeping up with all the changes is going to be a challenge. The AngularJSTO meetup is here to help you keep you up to date with latest and greatest of the Angular ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>PRESENTING:</strong></p>\n<p>We are always looking for speakers &amp; presenters for future meetups, so if you are using or teaching AngularJS, please submit to speak:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/AJSTO-Speaker\">http://tinyurl.com/AJSTO-Speaker</a></span></p>\n<p>if you have an interest in sharing your work with the group.</p>\n<p><em>Watch these and other AngularJS-Toronto meetup talks at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/rangleio/\">youtube.com/rangleio</a></em></p>","created":1368813619000,"city":"Toronto","country":"CA","localized_country_name":"Canada","state":"ON","join_mode":"open","visibility":"public","lat":43.65,"lon":-79.38,"members":2365,"organizer":{"id":8968154,"name":"Nick Van Weerdenburg","bio":"Founder and CEO of Rangle.io, a full-stack JavaScript consultancy helping companies embrace the inverted, next-generation web with Angular, React, Node and lean/agile design and development processes.","photo":{"id":118267402,"highres_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/c/e/a/highres_118267402.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/c/e/a/member_118267402.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/c/e/a/thumb_118267402.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com"}},"who":"Members","group_photo":{"id":436380259,"highres_link":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/3/highres_436380259.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/3/600_436380259.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/3/thumb_436380259.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com"},"key_photo":{"id":443612171,"highres_link":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/d/a/b/highres_443612171.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/d/a/b/600_443612171.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/d/a/b/thumb_443612171.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com"},"timezone":"Canada/Eastern","category":{"id":34,"name":"Tech","shortname":"Tech","sort_name":"Tech"}},{"score":1716,"id":22176763,"name":"Vue.js Berlin","link":"https://www.meetup.com/Vue-js-Berlin/","urlname":"Vue-js-Berlin","description":"<p>Meetup for Vue.js users, fans and all who are interested in learning more about this exciting new framework.</p>","created":1485860967000,"city":"Berlin","country":"DE","localized_country_name":"Germany","state":"","join_mode":"open","visibility":"public","lat":52.52,"lon":13.38,"members":160,"organizer":{"id":50947952,"name":"Norman K√∂hring","bio":"","photo":{"id":59193322,"highres_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/2/2/a/highres_59193322.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/2/2/a/member_59193322.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/2/2/a/thumb_59193322.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com"}},"who":"Mitglieder","timezone":"Europe/Berlin","next_event":{"id":"sxdhpmywdbcc","name":"Vue // Meetup","yes_rsvp_count":25,"time":1487700000000,"utc_offset":3600000},"category":{"id":34,"name":"Tech","shortname":"Tech","sort_name":"Tech"}},{"score":1716,"id":9189442,"name":"NodeMN","link":"https://www.meetup.com/NodeMN/","urlname":"NodeMN","description":"<p>A group for anyone interested in Node.js regardless of skill level or experience.
