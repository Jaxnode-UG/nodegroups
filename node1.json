Goals for the group are to spread ideas about Server Side Javascript, Node.js in particular, socialize projects, and discuss the technology and best practices. We'd like to keep the group informal but focused on technology and interesting projects. I think the ideal group would be made up of developers on OSS projects, site/app builders, systems integrators, architects, designers, freelancers/consultants, and even a few engineering managers who manage projects using node.js.</p>","created":1306972608000,"city":"Los Angeles","country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","state":"CA","join_mode":"open","visibility":"public","lat":33.99,"lon":-118.43,"members":2395,"organizer":{"id":4483764,"name":"David Aktary","bio":"","photo":{"id":124160632,"photo_link":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/0/9/8/member_124160632.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/5/0/9/8/thumb_124160632.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com"}},"who":"Noders","group_photo":{"id":45618631,"highres_link":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/c/7/highres_45618631.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/c/7/600_45618631.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/c/7/thumb_45618631.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com"},"key_photo":{"id":451422522,"highres_link":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/6/1/a/highres_451422522.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/6/1/a/600_451422522.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/6/1/a/thumb_451422522.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com"},"timezone":"US/Pacific","next_event":{"id":"vdqsvlywfbtb","name":"Monthly Meetup - Looking for Speakers & Sponsors","yes_rsvp_count":3,"time":1489629600000,"utc_offset":-25200000},"category":{"id":34,"name":"Tech","shortname":"Tech","sort_name":"Tech"}},{"score":2718,"id":12992382,"name":"MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js) Stack NYC","link":"https://www.meetup.com/MEAN-Stack-NYC/","urlname":"MEAN-Stack-NYC","description":"<p><span>This group is for anyone interested in learning more about building web applications with the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js) Stack.
