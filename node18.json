For those reasons, we pay our instructors and your class fee ensures our instructors are paid for their time.</p>\n<p><i>\"I don't see any upcoming classes\"</i>&nbsp;<br>That likely means we're taking a quick break between \"course tracks.\" Subscribe to this meetup to be alerted when a new class is added.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>\"I have a hackathon / event that your members will really like.
