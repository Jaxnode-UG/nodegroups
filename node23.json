Every thought about learning how to build websites but didn't know where to start? Here you can meet other people in the exact same spot who are curious, excited, and interested in exploring the fundamentals of web development. Each event will be guided by an expert who will teach a new skill and get us started on the path to programming fluency. Some of the topics we will cover: • Intro to HTML and CSS • Intro to Javascript • Intro to Git and GitHub • Intro to jQuery, Angular, Node.js (if your not sure what these are yet, no problem) All levels are welcome to attend. We feel that getting beginners and more advanced developers together is where the magic happens. This Meetup is owned and operated by Austin Coding Academy: San Antonio, which offers a 9-month course in full stack web development. These events are a way for people in San Antonio to get some free help and find out if taking a class with us makes sense or not. Our mission is to provide affordable, accessible coding education. For all inquiries, including food and drink or other sponsorship, please reach out to Chris Sica at chris@austincodingacademy.com","created":1461776614000,"city":"San Antonio","country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","state":"TX","join_mode":"open","visibility":"public","lat":29.47,"lon":-98.53,"members":638,"organizer":{"id":31032802,"name":"Christopher Sica","bio":"","photo":{"id":256054283,"highres_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/5/e/b/highres_256054283.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/5/e/b/member_256054283.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/5/e/b/thumb_256054283.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com"}},"who":"Coders","timezone":"US/Central","category":{"id":34,"name":"Tech","shortname":"Tech","sort_name":"Tech"}},{"score":1624,"id":19774670,"name":"S O L A R I S of Canaan - New Age Spirituality Meetup","link":"https://www.meetup.com/S-O-L-A-R-I-S-of-Canaan-New-Age-Spirituality-Meetup/","urlname":"S-O-L-A-R-I-S-of-Canaan-New-Age-Spirituality-Meetup","description":"We base our spiritual practice upon the consecration of TRUTH.
