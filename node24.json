It provides tools to enable easy data ETL, a mechanism to\nput structures on the data, and the capability to querying and\nanalysis of large data sets stored in Hadoop files. Hive defines a\nsimple SQL-like query language, called HiveQL, that enables users\nfamiliar with SQL to query the data. At the same time, this\nlanguage also allows programmers who are familiar with the\nMapReduce fromwork to be able to plug in their custom mappers and\nreducers to perform more sophisticated analysis that may not be\nsupported by the built-in capabilities of the language. The biggest\nHive deployment to date is the silver cluster at Facebook Inc,\nwhich consists of 1100 nodes with 8 CPU cores and 12 1TB-disk each.\nThis turns into a cluster of 8800 CPU cores and 13PB of raw\nstorage. Hive does not mandate read or written data be in the \"Hive\nformat\"---there is no such thing. Hive works equally well on\nThrift, control delimited, or your specialized data formats.

Chakras are believed to be part of the subtle body, not the physical body, and as such, are the meeting points of the subtle (non-physical) energy channels called nadi. Nadi are believed to be channels in the subtle body through which the life force (prana) (non-physical) or vital energy moves. The Chakras are represented by these ancient beautiful mandala-like symbols, each with it’s own color, and mandala of sacred geometry. Your art piece will be based on these symbols.
