This forms a \"singleton\" or \"world computer\" that is immune to censorship AND corporate AND government AND regulatory interference.</p>\n<p>A free market without middlemen, this truly empowers the individual user. Since the network is distributed and \"decentralized\" no central servers administer the users. The system has embedded consensus model allowing updates to be ignored or adopted by the swarm of users. A true democratically controlled entity.</p>\n<p>Ethereum has had its growing pains, with its rapid adoption and will continue to evolve and become more robust in the following months. Many are attracted to its potential and are frantically developing content to contribute to the system. First mover advantage is the cherry. <br></p>\n<p>Ethereum has already surpassed bitcoin in node count, blocks mined, hardforking and is rapidly taking market share......has accomplished amazing milestones thus far.......rocketing to the 2nd most popular crypto-currency Ether(ETH). (Ether is a small part of what Ethereum \"Is\" and \"Does\") its just an application that runs on the Ethereum operating system.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>On Sept 2, 2014, 16.5 million USD was raised through crowdfunding in 30 days. An impressive feat! This made Ethereum the 3rd largest globally crowd-sourced event at the time.</p>\n<p>On January 2015 Calgary Original Ethereum Meetup was formed with the purpose of getting local interests together to discuss and debate the future potential of Ethereum.</p>\n<p>On may 28, 2016, The \"DOA\" an application (DAPP) that ran on the Ethereum ecosystem raised over 160,000,000 USD.......they where hoping to raise $500,000!!!!</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p>Join us to discover why this project is so popular and how you can be involved early!</p>\n<p>I Look forward to our Ethereum discussions......</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Calgary-Original-Ethereum-Meetup/about/\">Current News and Progress click here!</a> <br></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ethereum.org/\">ETHEREUM OFFICIAL WEBSITE CLICK HERE!</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestones\">Module Release Progress Can be found here.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_funded_crowdfunding_projects\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_funded_crowdfunding_projects</a> <br></p>\n<p>Blog: <a href=\"http://blog.ethereum.org\">http://blog.ethereum.org</a> <br> Wiki: <a href=\"http://wiki.ethereum.org\">http://wiki.ethereum.org</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Forums: <a href=\"http://forum.ethereum.org\">http://forum.ethereum.org</a> <br> Youtube: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/ethereumproject\">http://www.youtube.com/ethereumproject</a></p>\n<blockquote> \n <p>Distributed network health and testnet: eth.stats.dev:&nbsp; <a href=\"https://stats.ethdev.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://stats.ethdev.com/</a> <br></p> \n</blockquote>\n<p>DAO: an application that runs on ethereum:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"https://daohub.org/curator.html\">https://daohub.org/curator.html</a></p>\n<p>DAO NEWS and current events:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"http://thedailydao.io/the-daily-update/\">http://thedailydao.io/the-daily-update/</a> <br></p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>New attendees will be granted a free SLACK membership to further enhance there learning, contribution and collaboration. <br></p>\n<br>\n<p>Welcome Aboard!</p>\n<p>Derek Cormack, P.Eng.</p>\n<p>Interim Organizer</p>\n<br>","created":1420585244000,"city":"Calgary","country":"CA","localized_country_name":"Canada","state":"AB","join_mode":"approval","visibility":"public","lat":51.05,"lon":-114.06,"members":50,"organizer":{"id":183377618,"name":"Derek C.","bio":"","photo":{"id":242700956,"highres_link":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/b/c/highres_242700956.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/b/c/member_242700956.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/b/c/thumb_242700956.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com"}},"who":"Ethernauts","group_photo":{"id":440332791,"highres_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/e/3/7/highres_440332791.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/e/3/7/600_440332791.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/e/3/7/thumb_440332791.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com"},"key_photo":{"id":435342529,"highres_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/6/2/1/highres_435342529.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/6/2/1/600_435342529.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/6/2/1/thumb_435342529.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com"},"timezone":"Canada/Mountain","category":{"id":34,"name":"Tech","shortname":"Tech","sort_name":"Tech"}},{"score":1624,"id":19309151,"name":"NeuroTechLDN","link":"https://www.meetup.com/NeuroTechLDN/","urlname":"NeuroTechLDN","description":"<p>NeuroTechLDN is part of the NeuroTechX network.
