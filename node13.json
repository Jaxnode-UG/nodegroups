Geared towards developers, architects and enthusiasts about Bluemix, we learn about Bluemix hands on with fellow developers and <b>Bluemix product architects(from IBM)</b>.  Our meetups are free. </p>\n<p><b>Subject Matter Experts, Developers, Researchers, IT Consultants &amp; Beginners who want to learn what this is all about.....all are welcome!</b></p>\n<p>Bluemix is an open-standard, cloud-based platform for building, managing and running applications of all types (web, mobile, Big Data Analytics, new smart devices, and so on). Capabilities include Java, mobile back end development, application monitoring, as well as capabilities from ecosystem partners and open source software all through an as-a-service model in the cloud<br>\n\n</p>\n<p>With Bluemix, you can code in your choice of language, such as Java, Python, Ruby, or Node, focus on running your apps and not have to worry about getting servers or installing software.</p>\n<p><b>What is IBM Bluemix?</b></p>\n<p>Bluemix is an implementation of IBM’s Open Cloud Architecture, leveraging <a href=\"http://www.cloudfoundry.org/\">Cloud Foundry</a> to enable developers to rapidly build, deploy, and manage their cloud applications, while tapping a growing ecosystem of available services and runtime frameworks. IBM will provide services and runtimes into the ecosystem based on our extensive software portfolio</p>\n<p><b>Bluemix: Making a difference in the cloud</b></p>\n<p>When IBM envisioned Bluemix, we envisioned a system which would answer the needs and challenges facing developers while at the same time empowering and enabling businesses to leverage their resources in the most efficient way possible.<br>\n\n</p>\n<p><b>BlueMix Helps Build and Integrate Apps Quickly<br>\n\n<br>\n\n</b> IBM’s new BlueMix services are designed to help businesses rapidly transform using Big Data, mobile and social technologies in the cloud. Some of the new BlueMix services include:   <b><br>\n\n<br>\n\n Cloud Integration</b> services to securely connect and integrate an organization’s applications and information in the cloud. Developers can use pre-defined connectors for accelerated integration, or develop custom APIs as needed to easily and securely tie back into systems of record behind their firewall. Integrated API management capabilities provide an easy mechanism to publish self-service APIs, that can be shared with the broader API economy. This allows developers to mix cloud-based PaaS, third party cloud applications, and on-premises systems behind security gateways, moving between cloud and on-premises systems in a hybrid, integrated environment.    <b><br>\n\n<br>\n\n Internet of Things</b> services allowing developers to register and connect networked devices such as microprocessors and embedded machine to machine sensors to the cloud, easily aggregating and reacting to data and events in real time. Organizations can build applications which efficiently manage, analyze, visualize, and interact with the massive quantities of temporal and spatial data generated by vehicles, wearables, mobile phones, cameras, computers, sensors and other intelligent devices. <b><br>\n\n<br>\n\n Big Data and Analytics</b> services for developers to deliver data-centric mobile, web-scale applications. With these new services, including geospatial, time series, predictive scoring, and reporting, developers can easily create sophisticated applications that provide real-time actionable insight so that organizations can predict outcomes and make better business decisions. For example, a developer could create an application that integrates sensor data, location data, weather data and usage trends from a network of equipment to identify and avoid emerging maintenance issues. In addition, new data masking, discovery and audit capabilities help developers create applications with built-in data privacy and security. <b><br>\n\n<br>\n\n DevOps</b> services enabling developers, IT departments and business teams with an open, integrated rapid development environment that scales from individual developers to enterprise teams. The DevOps Continuous Integration service will provide end-to-end “build” capabilities to speed changes through the development process, DevOps Mobile Quality Assurance (MQA) will help analyze user sentiment to spot problems before they go viral, and the Monitoring and Analytics service will identify application problems during development - leveraging analytics to help applications achieve availability and performance goals. In addition, DevOps will include a new RapidApp service that requires no coding, using visual tools to expand the scope of web and business applications developers can create. <b><br>\n\n  <br>\n\n</b></p>\n<p><b>IBM Bluemix is now in open beta</b></p>\n<p>Want to get started today?
