So for example, we may say, \"This week we'll build the map screen for a simple mapping application that supports push-pins, on iOS\".  </p>\n<p>We'll then break the group into teams of 2, attempting to balance out our experience and talent levels as well as possible.   After that point, we'll all go away and dive into the code.  Each group of two will work on the project for the duration of the sprint. We'll create an environment of open collaboration by way of an online project management tool.  </p>\n<p><span>The following meetup will then serve as a code review where we will conduct the following exercises as a group: </span><br>\n\n</p>\n<p>1) Compare architectural decisions and defend reasons for making those decisions</p>\n<p>2) Discuss extensions and other third-party components used to aid development</p>\n<p>3) Discuss your greatest pain points, or where you flat out hit a brick wall</p>\n<p>4) Attempt to gain consensus on the best methods of accomplishing each of the tasks, and compile those methods into a best-practices reference</p>\n<p>5) Merge our best code into a common area, and promote that version as group-certified (it's probably very ambitious to try to accomplish this during an actual Meetup)</p>\n<p>Then we'll define the next project, and re-start the development cycle.  We can either completely start over with an altogether different project, or build new components onto the existing one, gradually working our way towards an enterprise-worthy app.  </p>\n<p>One great thing about these short development sprints is that we can always bring on new developers at any one of our Meetups.</p>\n<br>","created":1393972246000,"city":"Parsippany","country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","state":"NJ","join_mode":"open","visibility":"public","lat":40.86,"lon":-74.41,"members":87,"organizer":{"id":135765842,"name":"Todd Nakamura","bio":"","photo":{"id":205302382,"highres_link":"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/5/8/e/highres_205302382.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/5/8/e/member_205302382.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/5/8/e/thumb_205302382.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com"}},"who":"Xamarians","group_photo":{"id":368948232,"highres_link":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/0/2/8/highres_368948232.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/0/2/8/600_368948232.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/0/2/8/thumb_368948232.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com"},"timezone":"US/Eastern","category":{"id":34,"name":"Tech","shortname":"Tech","sort_name":"Tech"}},{"score":1624,"id":18474414,"name":"Pepperdata - NYC","link":"https://www.meetup.com/Pepperdata-NYC/","urlname":"Pepperdata-NYC","description":"<p>Welcome to the Pepperdata Meetup group! The purpose of our meetings is to foster community among people using Hadoop in production, provide an opportunity to learn about interesting and relevant use cases, and hear about some challenges of using Hadoop in production and how people address them. Meetings will be held in NYC on a regular basis. Pepperdata delivers predictability, increasing performance, and visibility for business-critical Hadoop jobs on existing clusters running multiple applications. Pepperdata's software makes every Hadoop node more efficient, allowing companies to run more jobs on the existing infrastructure. Pepperdata was founded in 2012 by Sean Suchter and Chad Carson, former Yahoo executives whose groups were the first two users of Hadoop in production even before it was called Hadoop.
