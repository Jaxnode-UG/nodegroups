We meet 1-2 times a month, usually on a Thursday evening and generally have 3 or 4 industry leading speakers plus free grub and beer. Event topics include iOS/Android development, JavaScript (Node / Angular / React / Ember), UX, Ruby, Java, Analytics…the list goes on! <br> <br>Our meetups are often very kindly hosted at Sky HQ Leeds or at venues around Leeds - this requires some additional info for their security team - if you have your full name on your profile rather than a nickname this really helps.

There will be circumstances where there is a lot of energy, so remember to breath and stay in your heart with everyone that you connect with in every situation as we are all on a vision quest which can take us into some very unusual spaces. If you do have any complaints, or problems, please take them to Laura directly for resolution. We want to make to the Tour the best for you and for those you will bond with as well as having the best possible experience.</p> \n<p>Please be on time. The utmost respect you can give your fellow adventurers is the agreement to honor our time commitments each day as this will ultimately make the tour easier for you and for everyone involved.</p> \n<p>Connect with your fellow adventurers.</p> \n<p>Every person on this trip is incredible and highly interesting with their own story. We invite you to find out for yourself and connect to each person and get to know their special qualities which made them desire to attend this Tour as well as why the Mountain has chosen you as well as them.</p> \n<p>Each day has an itinerary. We plan to honor the itinerary but situations come up where we as a group make the decision to do something different, so allow for the winds of change to greet and guide us into our next experience.</p> \n<p>Remember to dress for the situation. It could be hot in August, so casual summer clothing is best, but Mount Shasta can get breezy and we will be going up to 8500 to 9000 plus feet, so bring a jacket and hiking attire. Glass Mountain is beautiful but as the name expresses, can be sharp, so if you have gloves bring them with you. Laura has led Tours to the Mountain of Glass for the past 20 years and so far no one has been cut by the black obsidian glass.</p> \n<p><br>Mount Shasta (Sacred Visionary Site) Full Moon Eclipse in Aquarius There are many types of phenomena that occur on and or near Mt. Shasta as it exhibits strong frequencies that create light. All around the Mt. Shasta area there are extinct and dormant volcanoes, cinder cones, artesian springs, sacred caves and mystical caverns. The mountain carries a dominant power which seems to get stronger every day.</p> \n<p>Over the last 70 years, numerous travelers have reported encounters with higher dimensional beings that live beneath and around this sacred Mountain. UFO sightings have also become so commonplace that there are books published with numerous photographs of sightings. Participants of vision quests, ceremonies and camping expeditions have all heard and felt the powerful vortex surrounding Mount Shasta</p> \n<p>Mt. Shasta is a site where people gather to perform sweat lodges and purification ceremonies. The intense purification of steam and heat within the sweat lodge mimics what's going on inside of the mountain. The darkness of the lodge is almost maternal and stirs the goddess energy of one's spirit. The ceremony directs itself to the physical and spiritual cleansing of an individual, the same as the mountain cleanses our spirit.</p> \n<p>Many experiences have been documented from people all over the world seeing UFO craft come in and out of the mountain, mysterious openings inside the mountain are also seen, where advanced inhabitants live. Vortex energies and portals along with mysterious lights have been seen that come from inside of the mountain. It is widely believed that there are civilizations of highly evolved beings residing within the mountain called the <br>Lemurians. Some are believed to be in another dimension that are not currently visible, yet at times many people have experienced a diverse range of phenomena that continues to expand the mysteries of this spiritual and sacred place</p> \n<p>Stewart Mineral Springs</p> \n<p>It is believed that the mineral waters flowing into the river are the most powerful healing waters on mother earth. There are many claims to the remarkable properties of the mineral water. Mental well-being, restoration of physical balance, and deep relaxation are common descriptions of one's experience. Some people even swear to healing; on many levels. Your experience will be unique to you, but the bathhouse, provides fresh spring water for your use and encourage you to fill personal containers with the water during your visit.</p> \n<p>Every spring, on our planet, has unique properties. The waters that flow through Parks Creek have been honored for generations by the local tribes as a place to clean and clear. You're welcomed to join the experience and participate firsthand in the soothing qualities of the waters at Stewart Springs.</p> \n<p>Dr. Emoto and the Stewart Springs Water Crystal In 2009, the eminent Dr. Emoto visited Stewart Springs with a small group of colleagues. He said that one of his senior Hado students was aware of the power of the waters and suggested a visit. One of the Hado teachers took a sample of the water directly from the creek near the Source House. That particular location is especially unusual as it is where the red springs (female), white springs (male) and fresh water flow together. The springs in Glastonbury, UK have similar properties. Those who are especially sensitive say they feel the higher vibration of the water in that area. The water sample was taken back to Japan where it was crystallized and photographed</p> \n<p> Shasta Vision Quest Tour 2016<br>Thursday Aug 4 to Sunday Aug 7th 2017<br>WITH <br>LAURA ROSE DESJARDINS and Staff</p> \n<p>DAY 1 THURSDAY<br> 2 pm Orientation--get to know each other<br> 3.23 pm Full Moon Ceremony on Mount Shasta and beginning of Readings by Laura<br> 7:00 pm Dinner</p> \n<p>DAY 2 FRIDAY<br> 7-9:00 am Breakfast and light Yoga<br> 10:00 am Trip to Pluto Caves<br> 1:00 pm Lunch <br> 2:00 Trip to Sacred Water Falls<br> 7:00 pm dinner</p> \n<p>DAY 3 SATURDAY<br> 7-9:00 am Breakfast with light Yoga<br> 10:00 am Journey Medicine Lake<br> 11:00 pm Mountain of Glass ...then lunch<br> 5:00 pm Sweat Lodge with Walking Eagle<br> 7:00 pm Dinner DAY 4 SUNDAY<br> 7-9 am Breakfast<br> 10:00 am Puja at Mount Shasta and completion of readings <br> 1:00 pm Lunch <br> 3:00 pm Closing Ceremony <br>Our schedule often changes with the winds of time and we'll find that the group has a mind of its own taking on its own identity. It's very important though, to stay with the group as much as possible to keep our Astrological family (North Node Energy) together. We also need to keep our thoughts in the present moment and our energy as pure as possible. Laura wants to make this tour one of the best experiences for you, so it's important to arrive at all events on time and stay with the group as opposed to separating. We will have plenty of separate time, especially when we are on Mount Shasta. Walking Eagle, Gentle Springs, Badger Woman, Sparrow Hawk and Spirit of Wind staff welcome you to a sacred Sweat Lodge Purification Ceremony. \"Taking a sweat\" is a traditional way of cleansing the body, mind and spirit. Through the sweat ceremony we can eliminate toxins from our physical body and create a space to allow our inner spirit to listen and reflect for days and weeks after. All are welcomed; all are honored.<br>Surrounded by majestic trees and the sounds of the creek, we begin by lighting a bon fire that heats the stones to be used inside the lodge. During this process, you are invited to join in the drumming and chanting, or you might choose to sit and enjoy the ceremony. You are also invited to offer your loving thoughts by taking a pinch of tobacco and contributing to the fire. Please feel free to contribute or ask questions.<br>Once inside the lodge, Walking Eagle will speak and invite all participants to offer their words and thoughts. With the glowing rocks and the darkened space, this is a deeply profound experience. If at anytime you feel discomfort, the flap door will be immediately be opened and you may exit to cool down. The Karuk Tribe and Stewart Mineral Springs extend a heartfelt invitation to you for this unique ceremony.<br>Respectful guidelines: <br>Alcohol, marijuana, and other altering drugs affect the ceremony in an unhealthy way. Please refrain using within 24 hours prior to the ceremony.<br>Clothing is required. For your comfort, please wear clothing that is loose fitting; preferably cotton or other natural fabrics.Please bring water and a towel.<br>Women on their moon cycle are invited to participate at a Moon Lodge rather than the male/female sweat lodge. A traditional sweat experience embraces spiritual rebirth which clashes with a woman's sacred power of birth. It is not appropriate for women on their moon to participate with others on a different cycle. If you are on your moon cycle, please participate in a woman only Moon Lodge Ceremony. We hold your power in the highest respect.<br>There is no charge for a sweat. However, The Spirit of the Wind staff suggest $30 to $35 donation. Sweat Lodge Ceremony starts on Saturday at 6pm and drumming Circle At 5:30 pm.</p>","created":1479157271000,"city":"Laguna Hills","country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA","state":"CA","join_mode":"open","visibility":"public","lat":33.6,"lon":-117.71,"members":59,"organizer":{"id":3407370,"name":"Laura Rose DesJardins","bio":"Laura DesJardins \n\nNationally recognized lecturer and teacher, has been a professional Astrologer for the past 30+ years.

The old saying \"Emacs is a great OS, lacking only a decent editor\" should be replaced in today's world with \"Vim is a great OS, IDE, and editor\"! I live within vim. If I need to open a libreoffice spreadsheet I do it from within vim. Ditto for browsers and everything else. Linux, and in particular Linux Mint XFCE, is a great OS. It works with almost all new and old hardware. And the peripherals you may have. And it isn't changing out from under you all the time. It stays out of the way to let you concentrate.</p>\n<p>Concentrate on what though? The idea behind this group is to be a place where you can come to ask questions and see how other people have done things. For instance how to setup an environment for working on node.js. Or how to replace your bash script with php or javaScript. As it being a new group it will naturally take the direction of what interests the members.
